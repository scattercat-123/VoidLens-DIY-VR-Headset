# VoidLens-DIY-VR-Headset 🎧
Here, I made a DIY VR Headset Compatble with SteamVR. Thanks [HadesVR](https://github.com/HadesVR/HadesVR) for inspiring me to make this! ⭐
Check out the [Journal](https://github.com/scattercat-123/VoidLens-DIY-VR-Headset/blob/main/journal.md) for the entire progress of the design progress!

## What does this VR Headset do?
 - This VR headset is fully steam compatible which i will be using pre existing firmware for it.
 - It support motion tracking(with a ping pong ball 🤣) which was inspired by the HadesVR with the idea of diffusion of light.
 - The display is 120Hz 2K which is also dual. Meaning each eye gets one display.
 - Pretty good FOV
 - Has hand controllers which also supports tracking!
 - Uses 50mm focal fresnel Lenses
 - Fully costamizable and fully 3d printed beautiful body 😆
